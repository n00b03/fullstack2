## Throw in JavaScript

**The throw statement is used to throw an exception (an error) intentionally. When an exception is thrown, the current function stops executing, and the control goes to the nearest catch block if one exists.**

Key Points:
1.throw stops execution in the current function.
2.Always wrap code that might throw an error in a try...catch block if you want to handle it.
